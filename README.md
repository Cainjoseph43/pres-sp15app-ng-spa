Abstract
--------
> SharePoint 2013 enables developers to create two different kinds of apps: cloud apps and SharePoint-Hosted Apps. The latter type, SharePoint-Hosted Apps, mean that the majority, if not all, of the application runs within the client. In this session you’ll learn how to build a SharePoint-Hosted Application using the popular presentation framework AngularJS. We will cover how to best structure your projects and leverage the SharePoint REST API & CSOM to create a great experience for your users, all without refreshing the page!
