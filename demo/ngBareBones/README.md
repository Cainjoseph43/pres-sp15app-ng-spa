> You can see quick video of the running application here: [https://youtu.be/AuyNIfdbhNI](https://youtu.be/AuyNIfdbhNI)

This demo was built using WebStorm, but can be run in any environment. I used the Node.js static webserver [superstatic](https://www.npmjs.com/package/superstatic). In the demo video above, it's installed globally & I start it by running the following in the root folder of the project (this folder):

````
ss --port 8000
